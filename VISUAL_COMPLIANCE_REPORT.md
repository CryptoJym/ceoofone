# CEO of One - Visual Compliance Report

## Executive Summary
The current implementation shows mixed results. The Vercel deployment is showing the default Next.js page, while the visual review tests reveal two different versions of the landing page - one for "Lawyer of One" and one that appears to be a basic text version. Neither fully matches the PRD requirements.
