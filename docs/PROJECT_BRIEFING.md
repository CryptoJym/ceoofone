# CEO of One - Project Briefing

## üéØ Core Context

### Utlyze Philosophy
Utlyze's core philosophy: **empower individuals by cutting through complexity and focusing on what truly drives value**. The 80/20 principle is central - eliminate the 80% noise to focus on the 20% that transforms.

### Target Persona: The Solo CEO
- **Who**: Founders and CEOs of very small businesses (1-5 employees)
- **Pain**: Drowning in operational minutiae, no time for strategy
- **Fear**: Missing opportunities, burning out, business stagnating
- **Desire**: Clarity, focus, growth without hiring a large team
- **Solution**: AI-powered "chief of staff" that handles the 80% so they can focus on the critical 20%
