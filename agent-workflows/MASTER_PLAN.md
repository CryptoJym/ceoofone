# Master Plan: 54 Agents Building 9 Websites Simultaneously

## The Vision

Transform 1,228.5 hours of sequential work into 4 hours of parallel execution using 54 AI agents across 9 repositories.

## Scale of Operation

### 9 Repositories (All Active Simultaneously)

1. **CEO of One** - AI chief of staff for solo CEOs
2. **Director of One** - Strategic planning AI for solo directors
3. **vCFO of One** - Financial intelligence for solo CFOs
4. **VP of One** - Leadership multiplier for solo VPs
5. **Company of One** - Business operations for solopreneurs
6. **Lawyer of One** - Legal guidance for solo practitioners
7. **Business of One** - Growth strategies for solo businesses
8. **Unicorn of One** - Scaling intelligence for solo founders
9. **HR of One** - People operations for solo leaders

### Agent Distribution

- **6 agents per repository** (average)
- **4 foundation agents** per repo (always ready)
- **2+ integration agents** per repo (dependency-based)
- **54 total agents** working in parallel

## Execution Timeline

### Hour 1: Foundation Blast

- 36 foundation agents launch simultaneously
- Each repository gets: design system, content, API, Next.js setup
- No dependencies = maximum parallelization

### Hour 2: Component Wave

- ~18 agents building components, databases, features
- Dependencies from Hour 1 now satisfied
- Each repo developing independently

### Hour 3: Integration Sprint

- Landing pages, auth systems, unique features
- Cross-component integration within each repo
- Visual differentiation emerging

### Hour 4: Polish & Deploy

- Final integrations, testing, deployment configs
- 9 production-ready websites
- All pointing to consultation funnel

## Command Center Setup

### Terminal Layout (Recommended)

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│  Monitor CEO    │  Monitor Dir    │  Monitor vCFO   │
│  of One         │  of One         │  of One         │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│  Monitor VP     │  Monitor Comp   │  Monitor Law    │
│  of One         │  of One         │  of One         │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│  Monitor Bus    │  Monitor Uni    │  Monitor HR     │
│  of One         │  of One         │  of One         │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Master Orchestration Commands

**Launch all foundation agents (36 agents):**

```bash
# Run from parent directory containing all repos
for repo in */; do
  cd "$repo"
  node agent-workflows/launch-wave.js &
  cd ..
done
```

**Monitor all repositories:**

```bash
# Create monitoring dashboard
for repo in */; do
  echo "=== $repo ==="
  cd "$repo"
  node scripts/agent-orchestrator.js status
  cd ..
done
```

**Check global progress:**

```bash
node master-orchestrator.js status
```

## Agent Coordination Strategy

### Phase 1: Repository Independence

Each repository's agents work independently:

- No cross-repo dependencies
- Parallel execution maximized
- 9 teams of 6 agents each

### Phase 2: Visual Harmony

While maintaining independence:

- Shared Utlyze blue (#4169E1)
- Unique accent colors per site
- Consistent navigation patterns

### Phase 3: Funnel Integration

All sites point to same goal:

- Consultation booking links
- Unified tracking codes
- Consistent CTAs

## Success Metrics

### Time Compression

- Sequential: 1,228.5 hours (51 days)
- Parallel: 4 hours
- Compression ratio: 307:1

### Quality Gates

- Each task must complete before dependencies
- All repos maintain Utlyze standards
- Mobile-responsive from the start

### Delivery Targets

- Hour 1: All foundations complete
- Hour 2: 50% of components ready
- Hour 3: All landing pages live
- Hour 4: Full deployment ready

## Agent Instructions Distribution

### For Repository Leads

```
You are managing [REPO_NAME] with 6 AI agents.
Your agents are working on parallel tasks.
Ensure Utlyze branding while maintaining unique personality.
Target audience: [SPECIFIC_ROLE] professionals.
```

### For Individual Agents

```
You are Agent [N] of 6 in [REPO_NAME].
Your specific task: [TASK_NAME]
Work independently. Trust other agents.
Commit frequently with [REPO]-[TASK] prefix.
```

## Emergency Procedures

### If Agent Gets Stuck

1. Check dependencies: `npm run monitor`
2. Restart agent: `AGENT_ROLE=[task] node agent-workflows/agent-runner.js`
3. Skip if non-critical: Mark complete, continue

### If Repository Falls Behind

1. Allocate extra agents from completed repos
2. Focus on critical path only
3. Deploy partial functionality

### If Time Runs Short

1. Deploy what's complete
2. Landing pages are priority
3. Advanced features can iterate

## The Payoff

### What We Achieve

- 9 professional websites in 4 hours
- Each targeting specific solo professionals
- All funneling to consultation bookings
- Consistent brand, unique personalities

### Market Impact

- Dominate "Of One" search space
- Multiple entry points to Utlyze
- Segmented messaging per role
- Authority in solo professional space

### Next Steps After Launch

1. A/B test consultation conversion
2. Add industry-specific pages
3. Build email capture funnels
4. Create retargeting campaigns
