## Running the Tests

### Install Playwright browsers (one-time setup):
```bash
./install-playwright.sh
# OR manually:
npx playwright install
```

### Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### Run specific test suites:
```bash
npm run test:a11y      # Accessibility tests only
npm run test:perf      # Performance tests only
npm run test:visual    # Visual review generation
```

### Run tests with UI mode (recommended for debugging):
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

### View test report after run:
```bash
npm run test:report
```

## Key Findings & Recommendations

Based on the test setup, here are the key areas to verify:

### 1. **Content Compliance**
- Ensure hero headline exactly matches: "Wearing Every Hat? Focus on the One That Grows Your Business"
- Verify 80/20 principle is prominently featured in subheading
- Confirm all 4 pain points are displayed as specified
- Check that testimonials match the exact success stories

### 2. **Brand Compliance**
- Primary buttons should use Action Orange (#FF6B35)
- Headers and primary text should use Utlyze Blue (#4169E1)
- Ensure proper typography hierarchy with Inter font
- Verify adequate white space between sections

### 3. **Booking Flow**
- Modal should contain all required fields
- Form validation should be user-friendly
- Success/error states should be clear
- Analytics tracking should fire on key events

### 4. **Performance**
- Optimize images for web (use next/image with proper sizing)
- Implement lazy loading for below-fold content
- Ensure proper caching headers on static assets
- Monitor bundle sizes

### 5. **Accessibility**
- Add skip navigation link
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper labels
- Verify color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Test with screen readers

## Visual Review Process

To generate a comprehensive visual review:

```bash
npm run test:visual
```

This will:
1. Create a timestamped folder with all screenshots
2. Generate an HTML review page
3. Capture all viewports and states
4. Provide a checklist for manual review

Open the generated `index.html` in the review folder to see all captures.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the smoke test** to verify basic functionality:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test smoke.spec.ts
   ```

2. **Review any failures** and update the implementation

3. **Generate visual review** for stakeholder approval

4. **Set up CI/CD** to run tests automatically on commits

5. **Configure visual regression baselines** after initial approval

## Notes

- Tests are configured to run against `http://localhost:3000`
- Make sure the dev server is running before tests
- Screenshots are saved in `test-results` and `visual-review-screenshots`
- The test suite is comprehensive but can be extended as needed
- Consider adding API testing for form submissions
- Monitor test execution time and optimize if needed

The test suite provides confidence that the implementation matches requirements and maintains quality standards across devices and browsers.
