# CEO of One - Email Sequences

## Welcome Sequence (5 Emails)

### Email 1: Welcome & Quick Win (Immediate)

**Subject:** Welcome! Your first 20% decision starts now

**Preview:** Plus: The 2-minute exercise that reveals your biggest time wasters

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Welcome to CEO of One! You've just taken the first step toward reclaiming your strategic edge.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. But first, I have a challenge for you:

**The 2-Minute Time Audit:**
1. Write down the last 10 tasks you completed today
2. Mark each as either "Growth" (directly impacts revenue/scale) or "Maintenance" (keeps things running)
3. Count the ratio

If you're like most solo CEOs, 8-9 out of 10 were maintenance. That's your 80/20 problem in black and white.

**Your next steps:**

- Watch how Jennifer went from 80 to 50-hour weeks: [Video Link]
- Reply with your time audit results (I read every email)

Here's to focusing on what matters,

James Brady
CEO & Co-founder, CEO of One

P.S. Tomorrow, I'll share the #1 mistake that keeps solo CEOs stuck in the 80%. It's not what you think.

### Email 2: The Hidden Cost (Day 1)

**Subject:** The $847,000 mistake solo CEOs make daily

**Preview:** It's not what you're doing wrong. It's what you're doing right... on the wrong things.

**Body:**
[First Name],

Meet Sarah. Solo CEO. Brilliant strategist. Working 75 hours/week.

Her business was growing 10% annually while she was burning out. Why?

She was amazing at everything. Too amazing.

She could handle customer service better than anyone. She wrote better emails. She managed projects flawlessly. She was doing 100 things at a 95% level.

But here's the $847,000 problem:

While Sarah spent 3 hours perfecting a customer email (saving maybe $200 in potential churn), she missed a partnership opportunity that would have added $847,000 in annual revenue.

**The math is brutal:**
- Time "saved" by doing it yourself: $30-50/hour
- Time cost of missed strategic opportunities: $400-1,000/hour
- Annual impact: $500K-2M in lost growth

The problem isn't that you can't do everything. It's that you're too good at things that don't matter.

**Sarah's transformation:**
- Implemented CEO of One's priority filtering
- Automated 60% of customer communications
- Freed up 25 hours/week for strategic work
- Result: 150% growth in 18 months

Ready to stop the $847,000 leak in your business?

### Email 3: Zone of Genius (Day 3)

**Subject:** Why your "Zone of Genius" is actually a trap

**Preview:** Plus: The 20% Pyramid that 10x'd Marcus's impact

**Body:**
[First Name],

Everyone talks about finding your "Zone of Genius." But for solo CEOs, it's a trap.

Here's why:

Marcus was a brilliant product developer. It was his zone of genius. So he spent 60% of his time there. Made sense, right?

Wrong.

His product was already good enough. What his business needed wasn't a 10% better product. It needed:
- Strategic partnerships (0% of his time)
- Scalable systems (5% of his time)
- Market positioning (2% of his time)

**Enter the 20% Pyramid:**

Level 3 (Top): TRANSFORMATIONAL (5% of time)
- Strategic decisions only you can make
- Vision & major pivots
- Key partnerships & deals

Level 2 (Middle): GROWTH (15% of time)
- Systems that scale
- Team/contractor development
- Market expansion

Level 1 (Bottom): MAINTENANCE (80% of time)
- Daily operations
- Routine decisions
- Task execution

**Marcus's shift:**
- Used CEO of One to automate Level 1
- Delegated most of Level 2
- Focused 80% of time on Level 3
- Result: 10x revenue in 24 months

**Your 20% Pyramid Exercise:**
1. List your last week's activities
2. Assign each to a level
3. Calculate time percentages
4. Face the brutal truth

Most solo CEOs spend 5% at Level 3. The great ones flip it: 80% at Level 3, 20% managing the rest.

Which CEO will you be?

### Email 4: The Morning Advantage (Day 5)

**Subject:** Start every day knowing your top 3 needle-movers

**Preview:** The 5-minute morning briefing that replaced my 2-hour scramble

**Body:**
[First Name],

It's 6 AM. Your alarm goes off. What's the first thing you do?

If you're like I used to be, you immediately check email. Then Slack. Then your task list. Then email again.

By 8 AM, you're already reactive, overwhelmed, and focused on everyone's priorities but your own.

**Here's my morning now with CEO of One:**

6:00 AM - Wake up
6:05 AM - Check my AI-generated Strategic Morning Brief:
- Top 3 decisions that will impact growth today
- Automated summary of what happened overnight
- Clear "ignore list" of noise that can wait
- Data-driven insight on one key metric

6:10 AM - Coffee and strategic thinking
7:00 AM - Execute on priority #1

**The difference:**
- OLD: 2 hours to figure out what matters, energy depleted
- NEW: 5 minutes to clarity, energy preserved for execution

**What's in your Strategic Morning Brief:**
✓ Smart priority filtering based on impact
✓ Decision recommendations with supporting data
✓ Automated responses queued for your approval
✓ "Protected time" blocks for deep work
✓ One key insight you'd otherwise miss

Jennifer said it best: "It's like having a chief of staff who worked all night preparing exactly what I need to know."

### Email 5: The Paradox (Day 7)

**Subject:** The counterintuitive reason these CEOs grew 10x faster

**Preview:** They did less. Way less. Here's the proof.

**Body:**
[First Name],

I need to share something that goes against everything we've been taught about success.

Our most successful CEO of One users – the ones growing 100-200% annually – work LESS than they did before.

Not a little less. A lot less.

**The data:**
- Average hours/week before: 72
- Average hours/week after: 48
- Average revenue growth: 127%

How is this possible?

**The Focus Paradox:** The more you do, the less that matters. The less you do, the more impact each action has.

Think about it:
- Spread across 100 tasks = 1% focus each
- Focused on 10 tasks = 10% focus each
- Focused on 3 tasks = 33% focus each

But it's not just about doing fewer things. It's about having AI handle everything else so those 3 things get your FULL genius.

**Real examples from our users:**

David: "I stopped checking email 50 times a day. CEO of One handles it. I check once at 4 PM. Saved 2 hours/day."

Sarah: "Automated 80% of customer responses. Spent saved time landing our biggest client ever."

Marcus: "Delegated all sub-$10K decisions to AI parameters. Focused only on strategic moves. 10x'd revenue."

[First Name], you've read all five emails. You've seen the proof. You understand the possibility.

The question is: Will you keep running harder on the hamster wheel, or will you step off and build something exponential?

Your future self is waiting for your decision.

## Nurture Sequence for Non-Converters (3 Emails)

### Email 1: Case Study (Day 14)

**Subject:** How Jennifer added $3M without adding hours

**Preview:** The complete breakdown (with numbers)

**Body:**
[First Name],

I noticed you haven't booked your strategy session yet. No worries – I know trust is earned, not given.

So let me share Jennifer's complete story with real numbers:

**Before CEO of One:**
- Revenue: $2M
- Hours/week: 80
- Team: Just her
- Growth rate: 15%
- Stress level: "Ready to quit"

**The Implementation:**
Week 1-2: AI analysis of her time allocation
Week 3-4: Automated routine operations
Week 5-6: Built strategic decision frameworks
Week 7-8: Implemented morning brief system

**After 18 Months:**
- Revenue: $5M
- Hours/week: 50
- Team: Her + AI + 2 contractors
- Growth rate: 150%
- Stress level: "Finally loving my business again"

**The specific changes:**
1. Email management: 2 hrs/day → 15 min/day
2. Customer service: 3 hrs/day → 30 min/day (AI handles 80%)
3. Decision making: Gut feel → Data-driven frameworks
4. Strategic planning: 2 hrs/month → 10 hrs/week

**Her biggest insight:**
"I thought I needed to hire a team. I just needed to stop doing work that didn't require my expertise."

Still skeptical? I would be too.

### Email 2: Common Objections (Day 21)

**Subject:** "But I'm different because..."

**Preview:** The 5 reasons CEOs think CEO of One won't work for them (and why they're wrong)

**Body:**
[First Name],

After 1,000+ strategy sessions, I've heard every reason why CEO of One "won't work for my specific situation."

Let me save you some mental gymnastics:

**"My business is too complex for AI"**
Reality: Marcus thought his fintech was too complex. Now AI handles 80% of compliance checks he used to do manually.

**"My customers expect personal attention from me"**
Reality: Sarah's premium clients ($50K+ contracts) now get MORE attention because she's not drowning in small tasks.

**"I can't afford it"**
Reality: Can you afford to keep losing $847K in opportunity cost? Most users see ROI in 60 days.

**"I don't trust AI with important decisions"**
Reality: You don't hand over decisions. You get better data TO MAKE decisions. Big difference.

**"I've tried other productivity tools"**
Reality: This isn't a productivity tool. It's a strategic leverage system. Ask any of our 1,247 users.

Look, I get it. Change is hard. Trusting new systems is harder.

But what's harder? Another year of 80-hour weeks with linear growth.

### Email 3: Final Opportunity (Day 30)

**Subject:** Closing your file

**Preview:** Unless...

**Body:**
[First Name],

This is my last email to you about CEO of One.

Either it's not right for you (totally fine), or you're stuck in analysis paralysis (not fine).

If it's the latter, consider this:

**30 days ago** when you first signed up, you were drowning in busywork.

**Today,** you're still drowning in busywork.

**30 days from now,** you'll still be drowning... unless you make a different choice.

Meanwhile, CEOs who started with CEO of One 30 days ago have already:
- Reclaimed 15-20 hours/week
- Automated their biggest time wasters
- Made clearer strategic decisions
- Started seeing revenue improvements

The gap between you and them is growing every day.

One final thought:

The strategy session is free. It's 60 minutes. Even if you decide CEO of One isn't for you, you'll walk away with clarity on your 20% focus areas.

What's the downside?

[CTA: Grab the Last December Spot]

If not, I wish you all the best. And I mean that.

To your success (however you achieve it),
James

P.S. If you change your mind in 2024, the strategy session will be $500. This is your last chance to get it free.

### Email 3: Momentum Check (Day 7)

**Subject:** Quick check-in on your CEO of One progress

**Preview:** Plus: How David saved 5 hours in his first week

**Body:**
[First Name],

It's been a week since your strategy session. How's your implementation going?

If you're already seeing results – fantastic! I'd love to hear about them.

If you haven't started yet – no judgment. But let me share what David did in his first week:

**Day 1:** Connected email and calendar (20 minutes)
**Day 2:** Set up morning brief (10 minutes)
**Day 3:** Created first automation rule (15 minutes)
**Result:** 5 hours saved by Day 7

Total time invested: 45 minutes
Total time saved: 5 hours
ROI: 667%

And that's just Week 1.

- Overwhelm: Pick ONE feature. Master it. Then expand.
- Technical worries: Our support team is incredible. Use them.

Remember: Every day you delay is another day of unnecessary overwhelm.

**Subject:** The $50K email that almost went to spam

CEO of One Community,

Marcus almost missed a $50K opportunity last week.

The email was buried in his inbox between a "quick question" from a vendor and his 47th meeting request of the week.

But his AI caught it.

The pattern recognition identified key phrases that matched his strategic priorities. It flagged the email, drafted a response, and scheduled a call.

Deal closed in 5 days.
