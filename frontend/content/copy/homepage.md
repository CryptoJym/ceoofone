## Pain Points Section

### Section Header
**"Are You the CEO, CFO, COO... and Janitor?"**

### Subheader
"If you're wearing every hat in your company, you're not alone. Here's what we hear from solo CEOs every day:"

### Pain Points

1. **Making Million-Dollar Decisions Between Email Responses?**
   - You're capable of 10x growth strategies, but you're stuck scheduling meetings, chasing invoices, and putting out daily fires. Your genius is being wasted on tasks any assistant could handle.

2. **Working 70 Hours But Growing at 7% Rate?**
   - The harder you work, the busier you get – but revenue stays flat. You're sprinting in place while competitors with clear focus are pulling ahead. Something's got to give.

3. **Drowning in Decisions That Don't Drive Growth?**
   - By 2 PM, you've made 100 micro-decisions and have zero mental energy left for the strategic thinking that actually matters. Decision fatigue is killing your edge.

4. **No Executive Team to Bounce Ideas Off?**
   - Every strategic decision lands on your desk alone. No chief of staff to filter priorities. No executive team to stress-test ideas. Just you, a mountain of tasks, and the weight of every choice.

### Reality Check List
- ✗ Checking email 50+ times per day while strategy suffers
- ✗ Attending meetings that could have been emails (or eliminated entirely)
- ✗ Manually tracking metrics instead of seeing automated insights
- ✗ Making gut decisions without data because "there's no time to analyze"
- ✗ Working weekends to catch up on the work that actually matters
- ✗ Feeling like you're building a job, not a business
