### ðŸ”§ Conflict Resolution Process

Used GitHub CLI to systematically:

1. Created local branches from remote agent work
2. Rebased each branch onto updated main
3. Resolved file conflicts manually
4. Merged via fast-forward to preserve history
5. Pushed all changes to main

### ðŸš€ Next Steps

Ready to launch **Wave 2** agents for:

- Component Library (depends on design-system âœ…)
- Database Schema (depends on nextjs-setup âœ…)
- AI Integration (depends on api-infrastructure âœ…)
- Analytics Setup (depends on nextjs-setup âœ…)

Run `npm run launch-wave` to start the next 4 agents in parallel.

### ðŸ“Š Status

**Time**: Foundation complete in ~2 hours
**Agents**: 4 of 15 tasks complete  
**Dependencies**: All Wave 1 gates cleared
**Quality**: All merges clean, no conflicts remaining

The agent orchestration system is working perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
