# CEO of One

> AI-powered chief of staff for solo CEOs drowning in the 80% that doesn't matter

## 🎯 Project Overview

CEO of One is a landing page and conversion funnel designed to attract solo CEOs and founders who are overwhelmed by minutiae. The site positions an AI-powered solution that helps identify the critical 20% priorities that drive growth while handling or simplifying the rest.

### Target Audience
- Solo CEOs and founders of very small businesses
- Leaders wearing every hat in their company
- Executives drowning in busywork while strategic work suffers

### Value Proposition
Turn overwhelm into focus and results by:
- Identifying the critical 20% that drives 80% of results
- Automating or eliminating the trivial 80%
- Providing AI-powered executive support without the overhead

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a **parallel agent architecture** inspired by the FCRA compliance system:

```
Multiple Specialized Agents
├── Design Agent → Brand guidelines, logos, design system
├── Content Agent → Copy, messaging, testimonials
├── Frontend Agents → Next.js setup, components, pages
├── Backend Agent → API, lead capture, integrations
├── SEO Agent → Keywords, meta tags, optimization
└── DevOps Agent → Deployment, monitoring, CI/CD
```

### Agent Orchestration

The project includes a dynamic agent orchestrator that:
1. Analyzes current project state
2. Identifies tasks ready to execute (dependencies met)
3. Generates exact commands for parallel agent deployment
4. Tracks progress and unlocks new tasks as others complete

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run the Orchestrator
```bash
npm run orchestrate
```

This will show you exactly which agents can be deployed right now.

### 2. Deploy Agents
Copy the commands from the orchestrator output and run them in separate terminals:

```bash
# Example output:
cd "/path/to/project" && CURSOR_BACKGROUND_AGENT_PROMPT="Create design system..." npm run background
```

### 3. Monitor Progress
Run the orchestrator again to see completed tasks and newly available work:

```bash
npm run orchestrate
```
